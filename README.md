# Web-scraping
This project is my first attempt on web scraping.
A python program that scrapes the 'meetup.com' website.

Approach:
I used BeautifulSoup to scrape the response from the website.
Firstly I scraped the data and organized into the events related to "React" web technology and those based out of New York.
Next I further cleansed the data to obtain events organized by groups with more than 500 members.
The output is stored in a csv file.
