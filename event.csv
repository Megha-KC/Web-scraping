MEAN Stack NYC,https://www.meetup.com/MEAN-Stack-NYC/,"This meetup was first started for developers curious about learning about and building with the MEAN stack, which is a stack that leverages MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node to build web applications. The organizer of this meetup has since moved on to using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node) and is currently dabbling more into blockchain development and other languages and frameworks outside of the JS/Node ecosystem so we decided to make this meetup a general programming/web development meetup that leans heavily toward JS and web technologies. Topics that we have given talks on in the past that have been on TypeScript, Node, TensorFlow and a myriad of other topics so the group has since long deviated from the ""MEAN Stack"" framework slant. So, from this day on the ""MEAN"" in MEAN Stack NYC just means we'll be talking about mean stacks (i.e. whatever awesome stack of technologies people are using to build software these days).As always, experts and the curious are welcome to join!","Thu, Feb 20, 7:00 PM EST",FREE,"New York, NY"
