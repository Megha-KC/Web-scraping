A Mindful Life Maplewood,https://www.meetup.com/AMindfulLifeMeditation/,"Dedicated to practices of mindfulness, A Mindful Life (originally the Maplewood/South Orange Mindfulness Meditation Group) offers facilitated groups and classes in the Maplewood, South Orange, and Millburn areas of NJ.

Together, we can practice staying grounded in the present moment by stopping, focusing on our breathing, and observing our thoughts and feelings without getting lost in them. By sitting and walking in this way, we can gain clarity, spaciousness and the ability to stay present to whatever arises without reacting habitually. By continually practicing with the support of community, our commitment to living mindfully is strengthened and our concentration deepens. There will be guided and silent sittings and a period of walking meditation, along with a reading and time to share and practice mindful speech and listening. The practice is influenced by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, Pema Chodron, and the teachers of the Insight Meditation tradition.

MEAN Stack NYC,https://www.meetup.com/MEAN-Stack-NYC/,"This meetup was first started for developers curious about learning about and building with the MEAN stack, which is a stack that leverages MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node to build web applications. The organizer of this meetup has since moved on to using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node) and is currently dabbling more into blockchain development and other languages and frameworks outside of the JS/Node ecosystem so we decided to make this meetup a general programming/web development meetup that leans heavily toward JS and web technologies. Topics that we have given talks on in the past that have been on TypeScript, Node, TensorFlow and a myriad of other topics so the group has since long deviated from the ""MEAN Stack"" framework slant. So, from this day on the ""MEAN"" in MEAN Stack NYC just means we'll be talking about mean stacks (i.e. whatever awesome stack of technologies people are using to build software these days).As always, experts and the curious are welcome to join!","Thu, Feb 20, 7:00 PM EST",FREE,"New York, NY"
